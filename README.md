## Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Solomon, and I am a Data Analyst
I did the TripleTen bootcamp for Business Intelligence Analytics to help my skills in the industry and to jumpstart my job search in the field of Data Analysis.
My skills include SQL, Excel/Google Sheets, Data Visualization using Tableau and Power BI, and I am also currently working on learning Python, along with many other programs to help me in my Data Analyst journey.
I am eager to learn and to help your business succeed by using my skills and problem-solving capabilities to help your business thrive.

I have a background in Retail and Sales, which I believe has helped me to better communicate with both team members and stakeholders to help them understand each project I work on. 
My experience has also helped me to be able to problem-solve and to think quickly to find solutions.
I have worked in fast-paced environments and know how to keep calm in the storms to better allow me to analyze data to the best of my ability despite difficult circumstances.

Some fun facts about me:
- I love cooking and think I'm fairly good at it
- I love watching movies and TV shows, especially comedies and thrillers.
- I love to try new foods.
- I hope to travel around the world and experience new things that I couldn't try anywhere else.
